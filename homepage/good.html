        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            I will be finishing my third year as an undergrad student majoring in Computing Science at the University of
            Alberta. I have a passion for programming and I treat it as a hobbey. Also, I am proficient data scraping,
            Python3 and SQLite3. I am eager to get some real world experience and make an impact on society.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Project</h2>
        <p>
            I have created a large Python3 stock analysis program over the summer of 2018. It scrapes and processes data
            of over 6000 stock tickers from multiple websites, and it stores the data in a SQLite3 database.
            After given some calculation settings, it generates a score for every stock and displays it along with other
            information in a table to determine which stock fits the user’s needs. The scraping use multithreading and
            multiprocessing for maximum efficiency, and I use PyQt5 to implement a UI. If the program were ever to get
            popular, I fear it would be blocked by one of the sites being scraped, so the program repository is not
            publicly available. However, it is available upon request.
