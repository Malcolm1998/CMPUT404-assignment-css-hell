Gutenberg Modifications
=======================

I deleted the old css from all the html files and replaced it with a link to my custom css file.
My style goal was to make is so it looks like someone wrote everything down with pencil a while ago.
I changed the font to the cursive Courgette font.
Furthermore, I increased the paragraph tag font size.
I also aligned headers, image captions and various other things to the center.
Images now have less defined corners, blurred, mixed with the background and are black and white.
The body background now has a old paper look.
I tried to put breaks in the "page" with black lines by placing bottom borders and changing background color of some tags.
I felt black and grey is a good color scheme if this page were to be drawn with pencil. So I added more grey backgrounds to change the coloring a little bit. If I wanted to change the text color, I would use the color property.

- Might work offline but, just in case, make sure you are connected to the internet. 
- Don't just look at the bad.png picture. The picture does not do justice. Load bad.html with a Chrome or Firefox browser.
